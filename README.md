# Second--Week-Task-MotionCut
I completed the second-week task of my Java programming internship at MotionCut, which focused on creating a temperature converter. This task  allows users to convert temperatures between different units, such as Celsius to Fahrenheit. it required implementing user input handling and displaying the converted results.
