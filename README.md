# Second--Week-Task-MotionCut
I successfully completed the second-week task of my Java programming internship with MotionCut, which focused on creating a temperature converter application. This task entailed designing and implementing a Java program that enables users to convert temperatures between different units, such as Celsius to Fahrenheit or vice versa.

To accomplish this, I had to handle user input effectively, ensuring that the program could accept temperature values in one unit and convert them to another unit accurately. I also integrated the necessary temperature conversion formulas into the program, allowing for precise calculations.

The completed task not only demonstrated my proficiency in Java programming but also showcased my ability to create a practical. It provided me with a valuable learning experience in software development and problem-solving within the context of real-world applications. I look forward to continuing to learn and grow during the rest of my internship with MotionCut.
